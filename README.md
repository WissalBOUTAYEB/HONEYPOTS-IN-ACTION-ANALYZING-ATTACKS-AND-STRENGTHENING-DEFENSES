🛡️ Honeypot Project: Simulating Cyber Attacks

🔥 Why This Project Matters

In today's digital age, cyber threats are evolving faster than ever. This Honeypot project is designed to:

Attract and deceive attackers by simulating vulnerable systems.
Analyze real-world cyber tactics to understand attacker behaviors.
Strengthen cybersecurity defenses using proactive and informed strategies.

📖 Project Overview

This project uses advanced honeypots to simulate vulnerable systems, attracting attackers to interact with them. By observing these interactions in real time, the project collects valuable data on attack methodologies. This data is then analyzed to better understand malicious tactics and enhance security measures.

🎯 Objectives

🚀 Deploy Realistic Honeypots: we Use  Dionaea, Cowrie, and Honeyd to simulate real-world systems and capture advanced attack patterns.
🧩 Isolate Attackers Safely: Securely isolate the honeypots from critical network components to prevent breaches.
🔐 Reinforce Security Layers: Implement Seccomp, AppArmor,  to contain and control any malicious activities.
📊 Visualize and Analyze Data: Integrate collected logs into the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for dynamic data visualization and detailed threat analysis.

⚙️ Key Features

Dionaea: Captures malware by emulating vulnerable services, enabling detailed exploit analysis.
Cowrie: Interactive SSH/Telnet honeypot that logs attacker activities and keystrokes.
Honeyd: Simulates entire networks, including multiple operating systems, to lure a diverse range of attackers.
Seccomp & AppArmor: Restricts system calls and enforces strict access controls to limit potential damage.
ELK Stack Integration: Real-time data processing and visualization with powerful dashboards and analytics.

📊 Data Visualization & Analysis

With ELK Stack, data collected from the honeypots is visualized through interactive dashboards, including:

Attack Frequency: Graphs showing attack patterns by protocol and service type.
Credential Analysis: Insight into commonly used usernames and passwords through tables and pie charts.
Attacker Behavior Mapping: Visualizes commands executed by attackers to understand their methodologies and goals.
