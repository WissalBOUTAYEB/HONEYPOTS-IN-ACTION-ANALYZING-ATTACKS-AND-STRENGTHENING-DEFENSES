🛡️ Honeypot Project: Simulating Cyber Attacks

🔥 Why This Project Matters

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated and pervasive. Organizations must adopt proactive defense mechanisms to stay ahead of attackers. This Honeypot Project is a cutting-edge initiative designed to:

🎣 Attract and deceive attackers by simulating vulnerable systems.


🔍 Analyze real-world cyber tactics to understand attacker behaviors.

🛡️ Strengthen cybersecurity defenses using data-driven insights.

By deploying honeypots, we create a controlled environment where attackers interact with decoy systems, allowing us to study their methods without risking real assets.

📖 Project Overview

This project leverages advanced honeypot technologies to simulate vulnerable systems, luring attackers into engaging with them. Through real-time monitoring and analysis, we capture valuable data on attack methodologies, payloads, and exploitation techniques. The collected data is processed and visualized using the ELK Stack, enabling security teams to:

📈 Detect emerging threats

🚨 Identify attack patterns

🛠️ Enhance defensive strategies

🎯 Objectives

🚀 Deploy Realistic Honeypots

We utilize three powerful honeypots to simulate different attack surfaces:

Dionaea 🦠 – Captures malware by emulating vulnerable services (SMB, FTP, HTTP).

Cowrie 🐮 – Interactive SSH/Telnet honeypot that logs attacker commands and keystrokes.

Honeyd 🌐 – Simulates entire networks with multiple OS fingerprints to deceive attackers.

🧩 Isolate Attackers Safely

🛑 Sandboxed Environment – Honeypots run in isolated containers to prevent lateral movement.

🔗 No Real Exposure – Attackers interact only with decoy systems, protecting critical assets.

🔐 Reinforce Security Layers

Seccomp ⚙️ – Restricts system calls to minimize exploitation risks.

AppArmor 🛡️ – Enforces mandatory access control (MAC) to limit application actions.

📊 Visualize and Analyze Data

ELK Stack Integration

📊 – Logs are processed and visualized in Kibana for real-time threat intelligence.

Attack Dashboards

📉 – Track attack frequency, source IPs, and payload types.
